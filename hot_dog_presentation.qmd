## Before I start

Open up the github project [sampaat/mol_hot_dog_fbprophet](https://github.com/sampaat/mol_hot_dog_fbprophet) for today and install the following libraries:

-   tidyverse
-   lubridate
-   prophet

## About me

-   Physics MSc @ ELTE, Econ MSc @ Corvinus
-   Hopefully soon: BI PhD @ Corvinus
-   Been to: Morgan Stanley / Alphacruncher as Quant / Data Scientist

## Production Planning at MOL Retail

MOL Hot-dog is one of the great success stories of MOL Retail:

-   Recognizable throughout the whole country (and in all MOL countries!)
-   Available on most MOL petrol stations
-   1+ Million Hot-dogs sold in August in HU

## How does data analysis comes to hot-dogs?

Business is business:

-   We want to provide instant availability 24/7 to maximise sales
-   But waste is costly and not environmentally conscious

## How does data analysis comes to hot-dogs?

Fresh products are delicate:

-   Frozen Hot dogs should be thawed up for 8 hours
-   After taken out of the fridge they have to be sold in 48 hours
-   It takes 30 minutes for a sausage to warm up
-   It can stay at most 4 hours on the roller (But the fresher the better!)

## Data/modelling opportunities

-   For most station a long history of sales data is available
-   Data availability and quality is top noch!
-   Gastro sales has good periodicity (weekly, daily)

## Data/modelling risks

-   We need to cover new stations with models as well
-   Marketing campaings and other external shocks can be challegning
-   Products and product assortments can change a lot
-   Finite capacities on the stations

## It's Business

-   Instructions must be easy to follow
-   There will be minimum levels to keep
-   Sales loss is "hard to sell" even if it is balanced out by savings on waste

## Followup

-   We compare forecasted sales with fact and waste numbers
-   Compliance is communicated to business
-   Compliant stations can statistically do better
  -   50% less waste
  -   14% more sales
  
## Modeling, benchmark

It used to be done with an average model:

$$\chi\left(D,H,N\right)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{W = 0}^{N} x\left(D-W,H\right)$$
Basically a moving average model with a weekly step.

## Modeling, fbprophet

The state of the art linear solution:

$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$
Sean J. Taylor, Benjamin Letham (2018) Forecasting at scale. *The American Statistician* **72**(1):37-45 (https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf).

## Fbprophet growth

Linear or **nonlinear, saturating growth**:

$$g(t) = \frac{C}{1+exp(-k(t-m))}$$
It can be made more elaborate with piecewise fit.

## Fbprophet seasonality

Seasonalites are handled with Fourier-series:

$$s(t) = \sum_{n=1}^N\left(a_ncos\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right)+b_nsin\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right)\right)$$
## Fbprophet holidays

Holidays are estimated with a local normal deviation:

$$h(t) = \left[I(t \in D_1),\dots,I(t \in D_L)\right]\kappa$$

## Fbprophet estimation

  - Bayesian approact
  - Uses Stan’s L-BFGS

## Lab

 We will do a lab exercise now to see if fbprophet is in fact better.
 
 Open up *hot_dog_prophet.Rmd* but **do not run the whole thing just yet**...
 
 Any questions so far?
